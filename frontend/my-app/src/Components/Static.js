    <h2>Deep reductions in CO₂ are not enough</h2>

    <p className="page"> From the melting of the poles to the weakening of the ocean currents that carry warm water from the tropics into the North Atlantic, every day the planet sends stronger signals of a climate crisis. On 9 August, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the first installment of the Sixth Assessment Report, emphasising, among other findings, that GHG emissions are not decreasing, on the contrary, they keep rising.</p><br></br>
    <p>The world risks global warming of beyond 1.5°C (and even 2°C) this century, unless we achieve deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions. We are faced with an increase in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions, and proportion of intense tropical cyclones, as well as reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost.</p> <b></b>
    <p>With these risks in mind, it is essential to strengthen public policies at all levels – from local to international levels – to achieve the transition to net zero and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p><br></br>
    <h3>Countries need better tools to tackle climate change</h3>
    <p>n May 2021, the OECD launched the International Programme for Action on Climate (IPAC). This initiative aims to support countries’ efforts to progress towards net-zero GHG emissions and more resilient economies by 2050. Through regular monitoring, policy evaluation and feedback on results and good practices, IPAC will help countries strengthen and coordinate climate action and complement and support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement.</p>
